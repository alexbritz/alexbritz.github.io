            <h4>Trainer, Facilitator, Coach and Lecturer</h4>
            <p>As a trainer and coach, I specialize in working with young scientists. I am by education an interdisciplinary scientist between chemistry, physics, and materials science. Next to science and academia, I am passionate about innovation, sustainability, diversity, and community. While working in academic research groups in Germany, Spain, and the United States, I noticed that science could be much more efficient and productive with improvements in communication and organization. Therefore, I made it my mission to explore new ways to facilitate science by helping especially young researchers to find new ways of working in academic research. In this respect I offer intense 1–3-day workshops, both online or on-site, in which the participants develop their communication, management, creativity and leadership skills. Furthermore, I continuously work on developing novel teaching and learning formats and finding new ways to elevate science.</p>
